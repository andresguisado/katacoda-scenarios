[Init Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) is a container which is executed before the app container is started. `Init-containers` are usually used for deploying utilities or execute scripts which are not presented in the app image and it needs to run.

## Create a Pod with an init container

Look at the file `init-container.yaml`{{open}}. 

This example runs an `init-container` which creates a helloworld file in a volume and an application pod will be scheduled if the helloworld file exist in a specific path and it can read it.

Create the init container:

`kubectl apply -f /manifests/init-container.yaml`{{execute}}

It could get some time until the init container finish successfully and the pod run.

### Pod status

Check the status of the pod:

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

If the pod is running means that the file was created and the pod can read it.

We are going to check it out manually:

`kubectl exec -ti happypanda -- cat /opt/workdir/helloworld `{{execute}}

You should see a result like:

`The app is running`

### Delete Pod

`kubectl delete -f /manifests/init-container.yaml`{{execute}}

or 

`kubectl delete pod happypanda`{{execute}}
